# Computational-efficient-FLIM-analysis

This repository introduced a hardware-friendly 1-D deep learning neural network to analyze average fluorescence lifetime from mono- and bi-exponential decays. And a traing aware quantization was employed to make it more compact. 

File structure:
.m: Hybrid training data containing mono- and bi-exponntial decays and ground truth lifetime parameters.
.py: Training file.
.py: Test file.
.m: Syntetic data for amplitute average lifetime.
.m: Synthetic data for intensity average lifetime.
